/*
1. Open the provided Java program in an IDE with debugging capabilities, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
2. Start debugging mode and set a breakpoint at the line where the program adds an item to a sale by clicking on the line number in the source code.
3. Step through the program until the bug occurs. In this case, we get a NullPointerException when trying to add an item to a sale.
4. Use the debugger to inspect the values of relevant variables and determine the cause of the bug. We can see that the items array in the Sale class is not initialized, causing a NullPointerException when trying to add an item to it.
5. Fix the bug by initializing the items array in the Sale constructor and test the system to ensure that items can now be added to a sale.
